long drive by myself in the night in the rain going home from kbbq

i was kind of scared of dying like i guess objectively that would be the most likely drive to have an accident

but earlier that day i had thought of course i would do anything to celebrate my best friend's birthday

i found a picture from my parents' honeymoon 22 years ago

they were wearing that one brown backpack that i lost a few months ago in my physics lab because of weird reasons

i thought about all the adventures that thing has been on—its life longer and more storied than my own—and i got a little sad that its gone

but i guess thats just another adventure for the guy

i used to hope that maybe it'd be put in some lost and found and i would stumble back across it someday

but now i hope someone nabbed it for themself and is taking it on many more journeys

"music is like cooking i definitely need to stop learning useless music theory and start cooking"

because i usually don't care that much for the proper technique and studying behind cooking i just make the dishes that i want to make and refine it over time

but i don't do that with music because i'm afraid of failure and not actually knowing what i'm doing so instead i just study up on how to theoretically make music without really making any

really all my hobbies have different largely arbitrary amounts of fear of failure attached and i rarely overcome it

### American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York
really pretty rocks

and even though I couldn't hope to capture their brilliance

on an iPhone 6 camera

I had the burning thought that I didn't want to forget how incredible it seemed to me that those crystals could form

so I tried anyway

also space and animals and bugs are cool
### Strand Bookstore, New York, New York
kind of a museum, too

I thought maybe sometime i'll take a few months off from work

to read books and rocks
