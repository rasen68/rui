# elementary school
### stereotype promise
when i was young i was surrounded by people (like, daycare staff) telling me how great at math and reading and even music i was

my current perceived 'intelligence' is largely the result of a feedback loop of people thinking i'm smart (because i'm east asian, etc.) and then making me smart

but now i can have fun and be stupid and learn and do whatever i want and intelligence and talent is all made up bullshit anyway and i don't care how much poeple think i have because some white ladies shot me with their math guns when i was 8

# middle school
i was kinda just a kid
### happiness
i was pretty happy in middle school, i had good friends and little to no worries and life was smooth sailing

and then i think my high school self seemed to regard that as like the peak happiness of my life due to some childlike wonder i would never get back

extremely loud incorrect buzzer i got it back its never going away

### projects
most of my middle school memories are these big ambitious projects i worked on with a particular friend group, making games and stories and universes and stuff

this is probably where my penchant for big ambitious projects began, and maybe also my fear of watching them fall apart 

but it wasn't really anyone's fault, just middle school boys being middle school boys

### friends
i don't really remember making any super deep bonds with my friends in middle school but i guess i cared enough to stick with them

but it was never about the deep conversations or the emotional moments or any of that it's just people who spend their time caring about the people who you care about

### learning
i had to practice cello and piano and tennis and soccer and figure skating and swimming and go to chinese school and all that as a kid and i never really tried cuz i never really liked it

some of those things, like the sports mostly, i probably wasn't really into because i never had any prerogative to go do them on my own, like i couldn't just go out and figure skate—but now i can and it's awesome

i can't imagine that now, but i'm still glad my parents made me do all of that and i'm glad that i'm at a point where i could love all of that and more

### christianity
my parents wanted me to be christian even though they couldn't because of cultural revolution stuff, so they sent me to all those christian summer camps and church events and stuff where i got pretty into it

but i guess slowly it kind of fell apart for me, the idea of religion just felt too arbitrary and made up and i never really had any deep faith in it

i think that buddhism feels so much more attractive to me because it feels so much more real, like the wisdom of my ancestors rather than a random guy and a random book

# moving away
### this was a big deal for me
i felt really upset about the prospect that i might lose all my friends for the sake of going to a supposedly better rich kid school

i agree with middle school me that the school sucked but it turns out thanks to one discord server staying friends with those nerds was easy enough

the neat thing about the age of connection is youre never really further away from anyone than you are from your phone

it wasn't really a conscious decision but it definitely makes me feel like not leaving people behind is worth it

# high school
### 9th grade
i was in orchestra, where i made some friends, except i was pretty insecure about it since i went from being the best cellist in the school to probably the worst

i also had really good grades, which would obviously fall apart soon enough

i think i expected the new place to suck a lot more than it actually did, and while i don't believe that my rich kid high school was great or anything i do realise now that new places aren't so scary 

### 10th grade
and then there was the pandemic and i started having having no face-to-face friends, doing terribly in school, rotting away all day

but even then i learned a lot of japanese, i got really good at tetris and chess, i found music and media that i deeply cared about, and i spent a lot of time playing games and writing stories and having fun with my (middle school) friends

it sure did suck and drastically alter the course of my life probably for the worst but at the same time i can't exactly say i'd take it back when if i took it back i wouldn't be nearly as close with a lot of the people who i hold the most dear

### 11th grade
i was just a loser, i didn't know how to readapt to rich white kid land and i just kept holding onto the comfort of my middle school friends instead, this didn't go great

i pretty much had no friends the entire year, school stressed the shit out of me, and things kind of sucked

but things got better as they always do

### 12th grade
so i woke up one day and thought "what if i made friends" so i did (this did not literally happen)

but that's basically how it went i just started talking to some guys i vaguely knew and now they're my high school friends and they're not great or really how i would imagine my kind of people to be but i still care about them and i still enjoy being around them

it's not really that hard to just open up and be friends with people, and while i'm still not super comfortable striking up conversations and trying to make friends with literally random people, i'm a dozen times better at just finding a social space for myself now

### this one person
who i met and super fell in love with and then kind of got too anxious to actually set anything up with and by the time i worked up the courage too it was way way too late

i still care about them—i always cared about them, so i should have acted on that and made it clear

not madly in love anymore though

# going to college
### i kinda screwed up
basically throughout all of high school i rejected that mentality of devoting my entire life to looking good on a college application, i thought it didn't really matter what college i went to and blah blah blah

which was kind of right, i still don't care about prestigious schools or honours or all of that, and it probably would have been pretty shitty to get sucked into that whole grindset culture

but also my parents are going to end up having to pay 200 grand for my schooling and while that will work out in the end and giving me the safety net to be stupid like that kind of is what they worked so hard to get educated and come to the states and make a ton of money for,

that's a lot of money that i could have saved if i worked harder, and arguably a lot of talent wasted on my part

but there's no point getting all upset thinking about a me that doesn't exist, i have to forgive myself and move on

and i can at least learn that it's alright to take big life decisions seriously, just a little

# college, freshman year
### life is so good
and so now in college i don't care about school or what i'm gonna do out of college and instead i spend all my time having fun

realistically though there are two differences:
- i actually am having fun, i'm so happy that like one of my defining character traits lately has been sheer childlike joy all the time
- i do care about school because i love learning and while i don't deeply love what i'm learning the process is still great
  - i'm not gonna sweat my ass off to try to get ahead of the program, i'm just going to study hard and do my best to get fulfillment out of it
 
# in summary
make friends, learn things, love yourself, be happy, life is good
