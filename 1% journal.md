### American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York
really pretty rocks

and even though I couldn't hope to capture their brilliance

on an iPhone 6 camera

I had the burning thought that I didn't want to forget how incredible it seemed to me that those crystals could form

so I tried anyway

also space and animals and bugs are cool
### Strand Bookstore, New York, New York
kind of a museum, too

I thought maybe sometime i'll take a few months off from work

to read books and rocks
### Kris
wow friends are awesome
