### my bed
i was watching a youtube video on my phone and i miniplayered it to go check discord and it got all choppy and i couldnt really tell what was going on and that sucked because it waslike a vaguely meaningful video essay

and i got like really fucking frustrated at that for no reason

and then i thought about how just generally unsatisfied i felt at that moment

this was by the way like 3 minutes ago from time of writing

and i guess i somehow sometimes expect to be super happy and never have problems

like i mean today was great it was a day off the job that was stressing me out is over i got paid i

did cool music shit i hung out with some cool people and had fun playing mtg things

didnt go entirely to plan but they still went okay as always and i had fun in the unexpected as always and

i was still laying there in bed like shit im not happy

not because my left ear has been clogged and my back has felt like an 80 year old's all day, not because i didn't do that well in mtg, not because i didn't get to hang out with my friend that i wanted to, not because the conversations i had with the friends i did hang out with were marginally awkward, not because i almost hit a car while driving and only got saved by my autobrake, not because 75% of the vocals i recorded for the song i'm working on aren't usable, not because i spent 80 cents on getting oat milk in my matcha latte that wasn't that good, not because i spent 2 dollars on parking, not because i have to do more work this weekend, not because i hate endings

but because it is just not possible to feel happy all of the time

and all there is is a little step i can take to feeling a little happier a little more of the time

i forgive myself

long drive by myself in the night in the rain going home from kbbq

i was kind of scared of dying like i guess objectively that would be the most likely drive to have an accident

but earlier that day i had thought of course i would do anything to celebrate my best friend's birthday

### my basement
i found a picture from my parents' honeymoon 22 years ago

they were wearing that one brown backpack that i lost a few months ago in my physics lab because of weird reasons

i thought about all the adventures that thing has been on—its life longer and more storied than my own—and i got a little sad that its gone

but i guess thats just another adventure for the guy

i used to hope that maybe it'd be put in some lost and found and i would stumble back across it someday

but now i hope someone nabbed it for themself and is taking it on many more journeys

"music is like cooking i definitely need to stop learning useless music theory and start cooking"

because i usually don't care that much for the proper technique and studying behind cooking i just make the dishes that i want to make and refine it over time

but i don't do that with music because i'm afraid of failure and not actually knowing what i'm doing so instead i just study up on how to theoretically make music without really making any

really all my hobbies have different largely arbitrary amounts of fear of failure attached and i rarely overcome it

### American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York
really pretty rocks

and even though I couldn't hope to capture their brilliance

on an iPhone 6 camera

I had the burning thought that I didn't want to forget how incredible it seemed to me that those crystals could form

so I tried anyway

also space and animals and bugs are cool
### Strand Bookstore, New York, New York
kind of a museum, too

I thought maybe sometime i'll take a few months off from work

to read books and rocks
### Kris
