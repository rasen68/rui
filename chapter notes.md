# elementary school
### stereotype promise
when i was young i was surrounded by people (like, daycare staff) telling me how great at math and reading and even music i was

my current perceived 'intelligence' is largely the result of a feedback loop of people thinking i'm smart (because i'm east asian, etc.) and then making me smart

but fuck them, because now i can do all of that for fun and sometimes i'm good at it and sometimes i suck

intelligence and talent is all made up bullshit anyway and i don't care how much poeple think i have because some white ladies shot me with their math guns when i was 8

# middle school
i was kinda just a kid
### happiness
i was pretty happy in middle school, i had good friends and little to no worries and life was smooth sailing

and then i think my high school self seemed to regard that as like the peak happiness of my life due to some childlike wonder i would never get back

extremely loud incorrect buzzer i got it back its never going away

### projects
most of my middle school memories are these big ambitious projects i worked on with a particular friend group, making games and stories and universes and stuff

this is probably where my penchant for big ambitious projects began, and maybe also my fear of watching them fall apart 

but it wasn't really anyone's fault, just middle school boys being middle school boys

### friends
i don't really remember making any super deep bonds with my friends in middle school but i guess i cared enough to stick with them

but it was never about the deep conversations or the emotional moments or any of that it's just people who spend their time caring about the people who you care about

### learning
i had to practice cello and piano and tennis and soccer and figure skating and swimming and go to chinese school and all that as a kid and i never really tried cuz i never really liked it

i can't imagine that now, but i'm still glad my parents made me do all of that and i'm glad that i'm at a point where i could love all of that and more

### other things that happened
experience with christianity, naruto, japanese, 7th grade music composition project, white boy drama i didnt know anything about, cross country

# moving away
### this was a big deal for me
i felt really upset about the prospect that i might lose all my friends for the sake of going to a supposedly better rich kid school

i agree with middle school me that the school sucked but it turns out thanks to one discord server staying friends with those nerds was easy enough

the neat thing about the age of connection is youre never really further away from anyone than you are from your phone

it wasn't really a conscious decision but it definitely makes me feel like not leaving people behind is worth it

# high school

# going to college
### i kinda screwed up
