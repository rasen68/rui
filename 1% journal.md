"music is like cooking i definitely need to stop learning useless music theory and start cooking"

because i usually don't care that much for the proper technique and studying behind cooking i just make the dishes that i want to make and refine it over time

but i don't do that with music because i'm afraid of failure and not actually knowing what i'm doing so instead i just study up on how to theoretically make music without really making any

really all my hobbies have different largely arbitrary amounts of fear of failure attached and i rarely overcome it

### American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York
really pretty rocks

and even though I couldn't hope to capture their brilliance

on an iPhone 6 camera

I had the burning thought that I didn't want to forget how incredible it seemed to me that those crystals could form

so I tried anyway

also space and animals and bugs are cool
### Strand Bookstore, New York, New York
kind of a museum, too

I thought maybe sometime i'll take a few months off from work

to read books and rocks
